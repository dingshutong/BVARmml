Variable selection in Bayesian VAR models using marginalization of marginal likelihood.
##

**BVARmml** is a Fortran console applications for research paper [Model averaging and variable selection in VAR models](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=xT78kg0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=xT78kg0AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC).  

The source code are conducted for three main studies:

- Numerical evaluation of marginalized marginal likelihood (**MML**) under independent normal Wishart prior
- Simulation study 
- Forecasting application (US GDP growth and inflation)
